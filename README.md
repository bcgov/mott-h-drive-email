## Deploying New Code
The build.yml github action will build the Dockerfile and push it to the OpenShift ImageStream you have configured. The Deployment in OpenShift is configured to update when there is a new image available so it will restart.
Before you can run the workflow, ensure you have these variables and secrets configured:
- `OPENSHIFT_IMAGESTREAM_URL` variable
    - Looks like `image-registry.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/NAMESPACE/` (including -dev, test, prod or tools)
- `OPENSHIFT_IMAGESTREAM_USERNAME` secret
    - You can use the Pipeline user
- `OPENSHIFT_IMAGESTREAM_TOKEN` secret
    - You can use the Pipeline Token (From pipeline-token-xxxxxxxx)

## OpenShift Components
- Deployment
- Service
- Route
- Network Policies to allow inbound traffic
- Configmap
- ImageStream (autogenerated on first push from Github
